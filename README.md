# HANDZONe Project

## Overview

The HANDZONe project aims to develop a VR-Supported Hybrid Learning Environment for Architectural Robotics. This innovative application will feature a digital twin of a robotic arm, providing users with interactive tutorials and exercises to enhance their learning experience in the field of architectural robotics.

## Features

- **Digital Twin of Robotic Arm**: A virtual representation of a robotic arm that allows users to interact and learn about its functionalities.
- **Grasshopper integration**: Allows users to create a Grasshopper session to import meshes directly to the 3D environment. 
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides that help users understand the operation and programming of the robotic arm.
- **Exercises**: Practical tasks designed to reinforce learning and provide hands-on experience with the robotic arm.
- **VR Support**: An immersive experience that allows users to engage with the content in a virtual reality environment.
