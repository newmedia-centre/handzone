                            <p>HANDZONe is a Hybrid Learning Environment developed to support education on robotics, specifically within architecture and built environment studies. It features a virtual lab with tutorials and exercises introducing fundamental knowledge and skills for programming and operating a robotic arm. It utilizes the Unity engine to create a digital twin of the robotic arm and a web server to enable real-time communication between the physical and digital labs.</p>
                            <p>The users can use HANDZONe (with or without a VR headset) to follow tutorials, practice exercises, and upload and run their programs on the virtual robot. They can also use it to connect to the physical robot to control and monitor its operation in real time remotely.</p>
                            <p>HANDZONe is available to use for anyone with a SURFconext ID. It is also available open-source on GitHub.</p>

                            <p>This project was supported by the Open and Online Education Incentive Scheme of SURF (Project Code: OO22-13) between 01.09.2022 and 31.12.2024. It was developed in collaboration between the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment and the XR Zone at Delft University of Technology.</p>
