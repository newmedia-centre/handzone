  title: TCP Joint
  description: The TCP (Tool Center Point) joint refers to the specific point on
    a robotic tool or end effector that is used as the reference for positioning
    and orientation. It is crucial for precise control and accuracy in robotic operations,
    as it defines the exact location where the tool interacts with the workpiece
    or environment. Proper calibration and definition of the TCP joint are essential
    for effective robotic programming and operation.
