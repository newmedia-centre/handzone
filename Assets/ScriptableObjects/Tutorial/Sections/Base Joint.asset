  description: The Base Joint section typically refers to the foundational part of
    a mechanical or structural system where two or more components are connected.
    It serves as the primary point of attachment and support, ensuring stability
    and facilitating movement or load transfer between connected parts. The design
    and integrity of the base joint are crucial for the overall performance and safety
    of the system.
